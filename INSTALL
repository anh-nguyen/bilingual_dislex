Installing DISLEX
=================

DISLEX has been compiled and tested on the following platforms:
* Sun Sparc (SunOS 4.1.3), cc/gcc
* IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2.5), xlc/gcc
* MIPS Ultrix 4.2A, cc/gcc
* Linux Redhat 4.2, gcc

If your platform is not one of those listed above, you should still be
able to build it with little effort.  In general, you will need MIT
X11R5 and a C compiler (ANSI or K&R).  The code is conditionalized so
that it can be compiled with either ANSI C compiler (with prototypes) or
with K&R C compiler. The code has not been tested with other versions of
X windows (X11R6, OpenWindows).

Feedback and suggestions on how to improve the system are welcome.


Building DISLEX
===============

If you have xmkmf, type "xmkmf", then type "make".  Otherwise, edit
"Makefile.noimake", copy to "makefile", and say "make".

FM uses two extensions beyond standard C libraries: strcasecmp() and
drand48(). You can get the code for strcasecmp() from NetBSD/FreeBSD
distribution if your system doesn't include one (check at ftp sites near
you or try gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/BSD/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/lib/
libc/string/strcasecmp.c). If you don't have drand48, you can use any
other random number generator available in your system (such as rand();
in main.c replace srand48 with srand, lrand48 with rand, and drand48()
with rand()/32767.0 or rand()/2147483647.0 depending on the range of
rand() in your system).


Running DISLEX
==============

The distribution includes a number of simulation and input data files
which are used at runtime. Please refer to "FILES" for description of
each of these files, and to "USERDOC" for detailed instructions on how to
run the system.

The X application default file (called "Dislex.ad" in the distribution)
should be installed somewhere in a systemwide app-default directory.
The file should be renamed "Dislex". You can also install it in your
home directory (or in $XAPPLRESDIR), or make it part of your .Xdefaults.

DISLEX can be run with or without the graphics display. If it fails to
open connection to your X display (or if you have so specified in the
application defaults or the command line), it will fallback to the
terminal mode with just text output. The graphics mode is useful for
debugging and understanding what the network is doing. The terminal mode
is useful when you want to train or test DISLEX in the background and do
not care to see what is going on in real time.

DISLEX can be run on a variety of X displays, including gray-scale and
B&W. In most cases, it should come up with a reasonable graphics
defaults without any changes.  However, in some cases you may need to
set the resources manually in the application default file. You may want
to replace the colors with black and white if you don't have color; you
may want to use a private colormap if your display has few colors; you
may want to slow down the display if your machine is very fast; and
because the fonts are not scalable in X11R5, you may want to change them
if your display size differs a lot from the default. The resources,
defaults, and possible commandline options that override them are
described in the file "Dislex.ad".
