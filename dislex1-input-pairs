# input-pairs: the input word pair file.
#
# This file contains the pairs of lexical and semantic words that
#  are used to train DISLEX. Give each pair in one line, with the
#  lexical symbol first and semantic label second. 
# The convention is to show symbols in upper case (because the 
#  representations were taken from uppercase letters), but the program 
#  itself is not case sensitive.
# If you want to train one of the maps with extra symbols without at the
#  same time training the other map or the associative connections, 
#  use the symbol "_" (underscore) to indicate that no input should
#  be presented to that map.
# Begin with the keyword symbol-concept-pairs. Do not put any comments
#  or other junk below it.
